we update Instructor.java for fetch=FetchType.EAGER ,  one shot deal for retrieving everything and fetch=FetchType.Lazy for retrieve data in another way

we wrote EagerLazyDemo.java for this project and run this in debug mode
and wrote FetchJoinDemo.java for retrieve data with HQL in Lazy mode ,  after closing session


when fetchtype is eager , we will see hibernate will load instructor and courses in one time , and when we want to get courses we just get information from our ram 

when we change fetchType.Lazy
we would see , when we try to get course, hibernate needs to go to db and retrieve data for our request again
we can follow these in debug mode , console logs



when we try to get data with lazy load , it needs an open hibernate session.
to solve this issue , we can use getter for once before session is closed, after we use one time, we can use another time as well even if our session close. 
OR
we can use HQL like FetchJoinDemo.java
